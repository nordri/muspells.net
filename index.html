  <p>Hello! My name is Fede Diaz. I was born some summers ago in sunny Seville. </p>

  <p>It all started when my parents bought an Amstrad CPC 128k, with a great programming manual for BASIC. It was 1986.</p>

  <p>But the 1990s came and with them the Intel 80486 and C programming. The pointers, the memory overflows, and the sudden crashes. With windows 3.11 and the minesweeper!</p>

  <p>Almost reaching the millennium in came the PentiumII. Windows 98 and Warcraft2 and Quake, those moments playing on LAN with the neighbor. With this computer I started to try Linux. RedHat Linux 7.2.</p>

  <p>I'd already started working part-time and bought the first computer I could call my own. A Pentium4, with Linux Gentoo. I spent some time with this distro until I switched to Debian.</p>

  <p>A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then. I've learned how to configure servers with Debian to serve web pages, directory services, application servers... </p>

  <p>Today I deploy Docker and Kubernetes over Cloud providers like AWS or GCloud as well as OpenStack.</p>

  <p>I design CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins to get software ready for production as fast as possible.</p>
